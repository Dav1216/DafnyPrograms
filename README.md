# DafnyPrograms
This repository contains three dafny programs that I have worked in verifying. 
map-multiset-implementation.dfy containing an implementation of a multiset ADT using a map.
prime-database.dfy containing a PrimeMap class that remembers whether a number is prime or not.
heapsort.dfy contains the verification of heapsort using Heapify with the bubble up approach and UnHeapify using the bubble down approach.

To run dafny on the files, the extension Dafny for visual studio code is the most convenient option.

When a program is verified by Dafny, it means that Dafny has checked the program against a set of specifications and has found that the program meets those specifications using mathematical logic and automated theorem proving techniques. The verification process provides confidence that the program is correct and safe to use in different circumstances.
